# My Personal Project

## Billable Hour Tracker

**What will the application do?**
As the name suggests, the application will track time spent on tasks attributable to clients through time entries. 
Tasks can put under distinct categories, and each category can have its own billing rate.
Users will be able to add multiple clients, and multiple categories for each client.
Clients, billing categories, and time entries can be added, edited, and removed as desired.

By the end of the four phases of this project, my goal is to have a robust application that will be capable of recording time entries,
but also display comprehensive reports based on those time entries.

In the future roadmap after CPSC 210, my plan is to include automatic time tracking based on the user's active window, upon being able to upgrade the project to a more recent version of Java.


**Who will use it?**

- Public Accountants
- Lawyers
- Other professions that bill based on time spent on work done


**Why is this project of interest to you?**

I am a former accountant that used to work in the Big 4 providing services to clients. 
Tracking time was very tedious and time-consuming itself, and I've always wanted to create an application with more quality of life enhancements than what is currently available.
