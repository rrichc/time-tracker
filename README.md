## Billable Hour Tracker

**What will the application do?**
The application will track time spent on each window open and active. 
Once the time entry has been recorded, the user can assign the entry to a billing code, and all future windows with the same name will be billed to the same code.


**Who will use it?**

- Public Accountants
- Lawyers
- Other professions that bill based on time spent on work done mostly digitally


**Why is this project of interest to you?**

I am a former accountant that used to work in the Big 4 providing services to clients. Tracking time was very tedious and time consuming in itself

the bold and italic fonts correctly but they will appear correctly on GitHub.
